<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In this lab we were introduced to riverbed and asked to complete some simple tasks involving setting up a network, setting some network parameters and then allowing it to perform a simulation</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>I went through the PDF following the steps it outlined.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ol>
<li>There is a difference in collision count between the hub and a node</li>
<li>overall packets/sec is 800 which would mean that each node sends 50 packets / sec</li>
<li>800 packets/sec for 2 minutes</li>
<li>nothing unexpected</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I learned how to set up a simple network simulation in riverbed, run that simulation and then view the results.</p>
