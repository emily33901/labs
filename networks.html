<h2 id="rd-september">23rd September</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In this lab we were given a basic introduction to the network fundamentals module a long with asked to asses what the priorities of a network should be in handling different types of packets.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Went through the worksheet with my partner to discuss the various scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>n/a</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This practical served as a basic introduction to the networks unit.</p>
<h2 id="th-september">30th September</h2>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>In this lab we were introduced to riverbed and asked to complete some simple tasks involving setting up a network, setting some network parameters and then allowing it to perform a simulation</p>
<h3 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h3>
<p>I went through the PDF following the steps it outlined.</p>
<h3 id="results-1">Results</h3>
<ol>
<li>There is a difference in collision count between the hub and a node</li>
<li>overall packets/sec is 800 which would mean that each node sends 50 packets / sec</li>
<li>800 packets/sec for 2 minutes</li>
<li>nothing unexpected</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="questions-1">Questions</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I learned how to set up a simple network simulation in riverbed, run that simulation and then view the results.</p>
<h3 id="post-op">Post-op</h3>
<p>packet/sec<br>
total packets per seconds should be 0.02 * 1500 = 75,000.  In bits that is 75,000 * 8 = 600,000.</p>
<p>There are 16 nodes each generating this traffic, therefore 600,000 * 16 = 9,600,000 Mbps.</p>
<h2 id="th-october-2019">7th October 2019</h2>
<h3 id="summary-2">Summary</h3>
<p>In this lab we attempted to set up a star network using a switch as the central node to collect some statistics, setting up similar statistics to last time. Unfortunately this didnâ€™t work as a result of a file error - so I was unable to collect any statistics.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-2">Implementation</h3>
<p>Once again I used the PDF in order to achieve the desired results from the practical.</p>
<h3 id="results-2">Results</h3>
<p>Due to the error above not able to collect any results this practical.</p>
<h3 id="questions-2">Questions</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
<p>File errors are bad.</p>
<h2 id="th-october-2019-1">14th October 2019</h2>
<h3 id="summary-3">Summary</h3>
<p>In this lab we watched some animations which outlined the behavior of packets through a switch or a hub.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-3">Implementation</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3 id="results-3">Results</h3>

<p>Reliability is complicated and it depends on what you are trying to do with it to determine reliability.</p>
